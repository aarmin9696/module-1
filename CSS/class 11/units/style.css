units-

1. absolute units - actual physical units that are same across all devices
 
a) px(pixel) < b)pt(point) < c)mm  <  d)pc(picass)  <  e) cm <  f)in(inch)  

2. relative units - calculated on the basis of another elements size

a) em - inherits from parent element 

b) % - inherits from parent element 

c) rem - (root em) - inherits from root element 

d) vw (view width)- w.r.t viewport 100vw means takes full width

e) vh (view height)- w.r.t viewport


we must use relative units bcoz it changes acc to screen size while absolute remains same thats not good
